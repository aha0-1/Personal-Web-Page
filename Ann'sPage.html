                My name is Angela Ha. I am currently a student at <span style="color:red;">The Univeristy of Oklahoma</span>&#9757;.I am pursuing a <b>Bachelor's in MIS and Marketing</b>. I have always been interested on how our personal data is stored and accessed, hence why I picked up a major in Information Technology-to gain knowledge behind the scenes of our little screens. I later picked up Marketing not only to expand my options in the business world, but to also understand what people are looking for in their daily need. I believe MIS and Marketing comes hand in hand. One is to develop and one is to meet the needs of people's expectations. My goal is to use my majors to improve technology and simplify the lives of aspiring technologist

                I graduated from Del City High School in 2019. I started my journey to pursue a college degree at Rose State College immediately after high school in the Fall until the Fall of 2020. Within that year, I attended The University of Oklahoma (Norman Campus) to continue my path of becoming an MIS major. At the OU, I participated in various clubs such as MISSA(Management Information System Student Association), ASEAN(Association South East Asian Nation), and AASA(Asian American Student Association). I spend most of my days at Price College of Business, where most of my classes are held. Later on, I decided to pick up a Marketing major so I can expand my chances in the business world as well as gather information as to what people may need to assist their lifestyle. It's also an excuse to become more creative &#129299;.

                As of right now, I am still studying and gaining more experiences day by day. In my free time, I like to create. From little things such as nail art to creating programs, like this web page you're reading. Anything to get my mind out of reality. As for the future I aspire to use my degree and the knowledge I gain at OU to bring my creations to life. I hope to become an analyst or developer. Anything that would allow my skills to expand. I also want to learn more about programming since there are countless ways one can develop a web page. This web page here is just my first step to growing my knowldge, and even though I may not get accepted to a company right away after one application, I will eventually learn and gain experience to find a place that will become my second home &#128578.
